    <h3>CSS Properties</h3>
    <p>In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), properties are used to define the style and appearance of HTML elements. <br>
        They specify how the content of an element should be displayed in terms of visual design, layout, color, font,
        spacing, and other aspects of the presentation. <br> A CSS property is always followed by a value that defines
        how
        the property should be applied.
    </p>

        <h4>Text/Typography Properties</h4>
        <p>Typography properties in CSS are used to control the appearance and style of text on a webpage. <br> These
            properties allow you to modify aspects like font type, size, weight, spacing, alignment, and decoration.
            <br>
            Understanding and using these properties effectively is essential to create readable and aesthetically
            pleasing text content.</p>
